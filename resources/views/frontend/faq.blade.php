                       <p>The binary MLM plan is defined as a compensation plan that consists of two legs (left &amp;amp; right) or subtrees under every distributor.

                       <p>Binary MLM plan is a network marketing compensation strategy used by many top-performing MLM companies. The new members sponsored by distributors are added either on the left or right leg. Upon adding two new members on either side of the subtree, a binary tree gets formed.

All the new members referred after forming a binary tree gets spilled to the downlines.

Note: Distributors become a part of the binary plan by purchasing an enrollment package. The enrollment package here means either a service or a list of products. The distributor buys the package and becomes a part of the binary MLM company.</p>
